# sum-numbers-android

### Notes
  * Only edited the following files: 
    * app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
    * app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
    * app/src/main/java/com/example/app/sumnumbers/MainActivity.java
    * The others were generated by default by creating a new Android Studio Project, Blank Activity
  * Android Studio provided emulator was very slow, it was stuck on "Finishing boot.." for about an hour
    * Downloaded Genymotion (and VirtualBox) as an alternative
    * In Genymotion, select Settings > ADB > "Use custom Android SDK tools" > Location is /Users/\<user>/Library/Android/sdk
    * Used Samsung Galaxy S6 - 5.1.0 API 22 emulator
    * In Android Studio, had to download Genymotion plugin, disable and re-enable Tools > Android > ADB Integration, select Genymotion Device Manager, select emulator, click Run to send app to emulator like normal (it will open automatically)
  * In GitHub repo, ignored /.idea directory although some of the files were recommended to be versioned
